# Captures the four curated store screenshot configs on every supported
# platform and files them per-platform, so each platform ends up with all
# four shots (the Pebble appstore wants at least one screenshot per platform).
#
# Each config is a fixture that bundles its own Clay settings + weather/radar
# data. capture-screenshots.sh shoots all platforms for one fixture into
# screenshot/<version>/raw/<platform>.png; this wrapper copies that run's
# output into screenshot/<version>/store/<platform>/<label>.png before the
# next fixture overwrites raw/.
#
# Usage:   scripts/capture-store-shots.sh [version] [start-round]
# Example: scripts/capture-store-shots.sh v1.0.0          # all rounds
#          scripts/capture-store-shots.sh v1.0.0 4        # resume from round 4
