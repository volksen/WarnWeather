# Capture the two-phase time-lapse on all five platforms. watch.now is
# compile-time, so every frame is its own build; a build produces one
# multi-platform .pbw, so we build each fixture once up front and stash its
# .pbw, then capture platform-by-platform. Within a platform the live emulator
# is reused across every frame (a plain reinstall, no kill); `pebble kill` is
# only run when switching platforms — and as a force-reap of QEMU/pypkjs
# stragglers, because plain `pebble kill` leaves them alive (esp. emery) and
# running all five emulators at once wedges the slow-booting flint.
# RUN ON THE MAC (needs the Pebble SDK + emulator).
#
# Stashed .pbws are reused on re-run (fixtures are deterministic), so a capture
# that dies partway only needs to re-capture, not rebuild. Delete
# build/timelapse-pbw to force a full rebuild.
#
# An optional platform list captures only those platforms (the .pbws are still
# built once and stashed, so a later run for a deferred platform — e.g. the
# slow-booting flint — reuses them and only re-captures). With no list, all
# five are captured.
